# Squeeze the Day : Cooking Blogs and Efficiency
## Justis Guardia - Digital Humanities 150 Fall 2020

### Introduction
Squeeze the Day is a cooking blog allowing for users to browse recipes in a very simplified and minimalist way. The goal of this site is to remove the redundancies and unecessary aspects seen frequently in modern cooking blogs. This website aims to create a site that users want to return to, which is rare for many personal cooking blogs as all the sites are so similar. Squeeze the Day strives for uniqueness through simplicity, rather than extensive and intricate designs.

### Design Statement
Cooking is a large part of many individual's lives and takes up a significant amount of time. Especially for families and parents with full time jobs, finding time to find a recipe, buy new ingredients, figure out how to cook it, etc. is too much. Additionally, current popular cooking blogs are overrun with advertisements and walls of text with unecessary details that can be useful but are not mandatory to cook the dish. Squeeze the Day is designed to improve the experience of cooking blogs generally, focusing on the target audience of middle-aged women, and making a site that is easy to use, navigate, and understand.

### Competitor Analysis
Redesigning cooking blogs is extremely important for middle-aged women with busy schedules and lives. To keep users organized, it is not only important to have an easily navigable site, but also the specific recipes must be easy to understand and read quickly. These necessities are missing on many popular cooking blogs, like the two I studied within the competitor analysis. Looking specifically at two frequently-used blogs, I evaluated the sites to design my own more simplified website.

### User Research
Obtaining research through testing, like usability testing and contextual inquiries, helps a designer identify problems with the product to improve how it is used. These types of tests allow for a designer to see how a user would react in real time with the product. They can show problems in the product but also show aspects that are well-liked or easily understood by the user. It is difficult for a designer to see there product in an unobjective way, so it is very useful to bring in outsiders. This is an important step of testing and designing as it can change the design earlier to prevent more work in the future and provides extremely useful information.

### UX Storytelling
UX Storytelling is used to understand target users from a more intimate level and work to understand their thought processes. This allows for a designer to take a specific user's goals and intentions in mind while designing the site. 

Through my experience with UX Storytelling, I chose three features to focus on and prioritize when desining the site:
1. Search Bar
2. Layout and Organization
3. Interactivity

Here is one of three user personas, scenarios, and empathy maps:

### Low-Fidelity Prototype
This low-fidelity prototype was used to see the organization of the site and see the flow between the screens. This is a very basic way to test the website and it is much easier to edit when moving to a high-fidelity prototype. When designing this prototype, I made sure to emphasize my goals for the project which were organization, clarity, and ease. I wanted this site to be immediately understood by a user and be free of any major distractions or confusing aspects.

### Wireframes and Design
Here is an image of my original wireframes as well.

When designing the website, I went through many tests to see what color and typography options were the most readable and fit the nature of the site the best.
Here are some of the design tests:

After deciding on my design, I tested it for accessibility. Here are results from some of those tests, specifically the tests relating to color-blindness and contrast:

### Evaluations and Revisions
I conducted two usability tests online over Zoom and two usability tests in person. I was able to screen record two of the tests to see how the users interacted with the high-fidelity prototype and which features they were most drawn to. I also was able to speak with these users to find their opinions, thoughts, and comments on the site. 

Some of the important notes and findings taken from these tests were
