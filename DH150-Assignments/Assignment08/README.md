# Squeeze the Day : Cooking Blogs and Efficiency
## Justis Guardia - Digital Humanities 150 Fall 2020

### Introduction
Squeeze the Day is a cooking blog allowing for users to browse recipes in a very simplified and minimalist way. The goal of this site is to remove the redundancies and unecessary aspects seen frequently in modern cooking blogs. This website aims to create a site that users want to return to, which is rare for many personal cooking blogs as all the sites are so similar. Squeeze the Day strives for uniqueness through simplicity, rather than extensive and intricate designs.
