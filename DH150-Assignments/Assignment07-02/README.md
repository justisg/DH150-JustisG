## DH150 - Justis Guardia
### Prototype Link

Further information on this high fidelity prototype can be found [here](dadfalsdf).

### Design
More information about the design process can be found on the page linked above, however since that version of the prototype I have edited a few aspects of the design. In particular, I changed the design of the search bar in the center of the home page and the search page. From comments from other students in the class, I was made aware that the search bar looked more like a button, and as such might lead users to not understand its function at a quick glance. Because of this, I changed it to look more like a traditional search bar to hopefully improve the usability. 

### Tasks

### Interactions


### Wireflow
Here is a screenshot of the many wireflows and interactivity options within the prototype. 

Through feedback from fellow students, I added back buttons to every page that allow the user to return to the previously viewed page in the prototype. I also added more pages to the site and edited the wireflows to reflect that. In particular I added a “Saved Recipes” page which is accessible from every page. In my original prototype, the header said “Log In,” but this version of the prototype assumes that the user is already logged in, as this would give them access to their saved recipes. 

### Cognitive Walkthrough
A screen recording of this cognitive walkthrough can be found [here](alskjf).

Through this cognitive walkthrough, I was able to see that the majority of the pages on the site is very consistent and understandable. Some specific comments from the user were “”. After this walkthrough, I edited _______. This changes are made available in the linked version of the prototype.
