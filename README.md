# Cooking Blogs and Storytelling
## Justis Guardia - Digital Humanities 150
Cooking blogs and websites are incredibly popular, especially within the demographic of middle-aged women, as they should provide easy access to recipes of all skill levels and with a variety of ingredients. The personal blogs, rather than the food or recipe companies, also allow readers to provide a personal connection to their author through enjoying their recipes and seeing their images. Unfortunately, these pages can become overrun with personal anecdotes and unnecessary details, drastically increasing both the amount of time needed to find a useable recipe and the difficulty in understanding the primary steps. Through my analysis and subsequent design, I hope to provide alternative options for the way these blogs are set up, to benefit both the authors and the readers.
