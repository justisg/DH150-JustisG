#DH150 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry

##Introductory Steps

###Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will be 

What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for safety because they feel that they are parking in a proper location and they can find out additional information about this location pertaining to safety as well. They feel that they are not having a difficult driving or parking experience.
What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to satisfy this need for knowing where to park include other applications, which are popular, but from personal observation, do not seem to be very commonly used among my target demographic. For large events or specific venues, there is usually information provided on websites for associated parking. Additionally, people often search for parking in the moment, and they also might look up “parking nearby” when using navigational tools like Google Maps or Apple Maps.
What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Certain limitations for traveling and parking include not knowing availability ahead of time and as a result, spending a lot of time looking for parking or not heading out to a destination at all. Added functionality to the ParkMobile app could definitely help users discover places that they feel comfortable visiting due to positive parking situations and ensure that they become repeat visitors.

###Step 2: Identify target users
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Demographic: people of a legal driving age, own a car, in Los Angeles, likely not tourists, more likely to be current college students or recent grads
Preferences: users have the desire and ability to drive to places and thus, need a parking solution to assist them
Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application
Where would the users do that activity?
There are two main activities that can be accomplished using the ParkMobile app — paying for parking on the spot and reserving parking ahead of time at a specific venue. Users would pay for parking on the spot directly in parking lots, while reserving parking ahead of time can be accomplished remotely by users from wherever they choose to do so. The user interviewed in this contextual inquiry participated in both tasks, but with more emphasis on the second one. If users were doing the simple “paying on the spot” activity but without using ParkMobile, they would still be doing this activity in a parking lot, and similarly, could book parking ahead of time from the place of their choosing.
What would the users do to complete that activity?
To pay for parking on the spot, users would either pay a parking attendant, use an automated ticket kiosk, or use a mobile app. To reserve parking in advance, users would likely research the best parking options on the Internet before making an online reservation or calling in.

###Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
The two observation methods I employed include participatory observation and ethnographic research.
Ethnographic research simply involves observing how people in UCLA Parking Structure 2 seem to be paying for parking. Some of my observations include:
Those who pay at the physical pay stations appear to be older people and people who do not park much at UCLA / newcomers who are confused as to how they should pay for parking. Once I have seen a girl sprinting back to her car in order to avoid receiving a ticket for going past the time limit she had paid for.
Many individuals park and walk quickly to and from their cars — these people are likely utilizing the application due to the fact that they are moving quickly and do not stop by the parking ticket machine. They are also not parking in the permit area, but in the “visitor parking” area.
There is generally an even split between both kinds of user personas present at UCLA Parking Structure 2. I have also anecdotally heard that some people do not pay for parking in this structure, not only from the desire to avoid spending money, but also because of the often clunky payment process.
The ParkMobile application is helpful in places where you have not been before, if you are a regular user of ParkMobile. For example, I was parking at UCSD and the physical signage at the parking lot was quite confusing (spaces marked A, B and V), but the ParkMobile application told me that paying would only be valid for stalls marked with the letter V for visitor. Other individuals who only observed the physical signage did not receive this insight and may have gotten ticketed.
I conducted participatory observation research with a friend who fits my target demographic details. Please find the materials used in the next section.

###Here are some interesting quotes and insights from the interview:
1️⃣ How the user chooses to plan their parking ahead of time (3:04)
If I know where I'm going, I like to plan ahead so I will try. If I'm going to a difficult place, an area that I know is going to be very difficult to find parking, like Downtown LA, I will do research in advance like I will look for parking structures and save the address of the parking structure in my phone. But if it's like the grocery store, I know where the parking is. I'll find a spot eventually.
2️⃣ The user's preferences on paid parking (5:03)
I prefer to abstain from going to places that charge exorbitant amounts of money or don't give you the option of at least like an hour free parking. So I'm like, "That's lame." You're capitalizing on people's needs.
3️⃣ What the user dislikes about the way they look for parking currently (6:13)
You never know what you're going to get. Like, you don't know if it's going to be available, if there are places (parking spots) that are gonna be open.
4️⃣ The user's ranking of the importance of parking (on a scale of 1-10) as a component of an entire trip (17:40)
Okay, so, back to one of your other questions about what if it's important, or how important it is or like, how much will I suffer. Even if the parking is difficult, like, if I'm going somewhere for the first time, fine, I'll suffer through but then the next time it is now a factor I know that it's going to be difficult. So that is becomes a bigger portion of my number — I may turn into like a six or seven. So I think it depends on destination or whether and I've been there, but also I could be willing to give it another shot.

###Reflection
I enjoyed the contextual inquiry process because of the freedom it gave me to make observations and learn from other users with neither me nor them being inhibited by any kind of preconceptions, like the user/participant may have been in the more formal Usability Test. I found the additional questions, not only about the product, but about the user’s background and personal conceptions of the space/community I am exploring to be particularly interesting. Several of the points made by the participant aligned with ideas I had already had regarding new features for the product, so it was great to see this unbiased validation, since this participant was not at all informed about my ideas. I appreciated the participant’s openness and addition of many details into their descriptions and statements — this interview allowed me to acquire a pretty clear idea of one kind of user persona. However, I am not sure if I did every component of this user interview correctly as I did pose some guiding questions/statements to the participant without following as strict of guidelines as outlined in the example script. I think what would be helpful to me would be to be a participant in a study myself and see how other more experienced researchers conduct such interviews.
