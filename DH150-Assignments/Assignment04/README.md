## Introductory Steps

### Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**

This project will support users through increasing the ease of browsing and using online recipe blogs. It will implement useful features that assist in organization and simplicity and remove the unnecessary aspects typically found on these blogs. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**

The basic need involved is eliminating nonessential and extraneous aspects of the site. This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for simplicity in cooking, as it is important to be focused and organized while working in the kitchen for both efficiency and for safety. 


**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

The current popular cooking blogs were established to satisfy the needs of at-home cooks needing simple ways to view and browse recipes from home on their electronic devices. However, throughout the commercialization of these sites, they have become overrun with advertisements and useless additions that make it more difficult for the user to understand and use the site as it is designed. To make money but not have advertisements websites or companies will introduce a paid subscription in which you can access the recipes without ads. Though this solution is detrimental to the user as well, as it prevents them from finding the best option on multiple cooking websites, and rather they are essentially restricted to the one they pay for.


**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

Certain limitations for finding recipes are an inability to quickly compare many recipes between different sites, simplicity within the recipes and websites. Furthermore, being able to insert specific ingredients and find only recipes that include them would prevent a lot of wasted time on recipes that will not work. Additions like these to these current websites will help the user easily navigate the site and lead to more frequent uses.

### Step 2: Identify target users
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**

**Demographic**: Individuals who enjoy cooking, those learning how to cook for the first time, or those needing to cook for specific situations.
**Preferences**: Users of recipe blogs consistently want brevity, simplicity, and clarity.
**Expertise**: Users of any expertise level should be able to navigate the websites and understand the recipes.


**Where would the users do that activity?**

The users would be able to browse for recipes anywhere they have an electronic device and connectivity to the internet, but they would need to be accessing the recipe when they are going to cook it within a kitchen. A majority of recipe browsing and cooking will be done at the user’s home. If not all of the necessary ingredients are already within the home, it would require a trip to the grocery store to obtain them, but the majority of the activity is done within the home.

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**

Finding a recipe and cooking it could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple. It is possible the user has a preferred way to save and store recipes to go back to when they want to cook something or want to browse new recipes that they already have saved. 

### Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
The observation method I employed was direct observation. I interviewed my participant who is a member of my target demographic directly through specific questions about the use of cooking blogs and actions on a specific cooking site.

### Meaningful Insights from the Interview:

*"I would rather have less information. I don't mind a few pictures, but I don't want to hear about someone's opinions about shopping for string to wrap a roast in. So I would like it to be quicker and that I can get through it without having to scroll too much."*

This is a very interesting quote that defines the dislike of users to have too much excess information within the page of the recipe. It seemed to be a constant critique, both on this site in particular and on recipe blogs in general, that there is too much description and useless details to find it easy to access and understand the recipe.

*"I think I might get lost in a site and look for recipes. And I could find myself spending five or 10 minutes looking around to see something if they had it presented in an interesting way."*

Because recipe sites are supposed to be useful tools for cooks, browsing is a less important factor in the ease and usefullness of the site, but it is interesting to see what would lead someone to want to browse for longer on the site. Images and good organization seem to be the most important factors.

### Reflection

I really enjoyed this interview as it was more flexible than the usability test. The interaction between moderator and participant seemed easier and I felt as though I learned more about how someone of the target demographic actually goes about using websites like these. The questions about their background using similar sites was extremely helpful as well, and I think that getting to know more about the participant’s personal connection to the site allowed for further understanding and conclusions. I definitely agreed with many of the discussed points and I appreciated learning more about other reasonings people like or dislike similar sites. One difficulty however was not injecting with additional information or agreeing with the participant, as I worry that I would be leading them with anything I said or did in response to their actions. I overall really enjoyed the adaptability of this interview format and I feel as though I learned a lot about the sites.
