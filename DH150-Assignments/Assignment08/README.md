# Squeeze the Day : Cooking Blogs and Efficiency
## Justis Guardia - Digital Humanities 150 Fall 2020

### Introduction
Squeeze the Day is a cooking blog allowing for users to browse recipes in a very simplified and minimalist way. The goal of this site is to remove the redundancies and unecessary aspects seen frequently in modern cooking blogs. This website aims to create a site that users want to return to, which is rare for many personal cooking blogs as all the sites are so similar. Squeeze the Day strives for uniqueness through simplicity, rather than extensive and intricate designs.

### Design Statement
Cooking is a large part of many individual's lives and takes up a significant amount of time. Especially for families and parents with full time jobs, finding time to find a recipe, buy new ingredients, figure out how to cook it, etc. is too much. Additionally, current popular cooking blogs are overrun with advertisements and walls of text with unecessary details that can be useful but are not mandatory to cook the dish. Squeeze the Day is designed to improve the experience of cooking blogs generally, focusing on the target audience of middle-aged women, and making a site that is easy to use, navigate, and understand.

### Competitor Analysis
Redesigning cooking blogs is extremely important for middle-aged women with busy schedules and lives. To keep users organized, it is not only important to have an easily navigable site, but also the specific recipes must be easy to understand and read quickly. These necessities are missing on many popular cooking blogs, like the two I studied within the competitor analysis. Looking specifically at two frequently-used blogs, I evaluated the sites to design my own more simplified website.
