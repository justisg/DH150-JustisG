### Digital Storytelling

Storytelling through user experience is important so the designer can best know their user and understand their goals, priorities, and behavior. In understanding a multitude of different possible personas, more perspectives are gained and used to improve the site. This type of storytelling is very useful for the designer to understand all varieties of user and can help identify ways to make the product better for the users in a very specific way.
