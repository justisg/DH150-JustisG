# Low Fidelity Prototype
## DH150 - Justis Guardia
### Description
In this project, I am going to be redesigning the typical cooking blog website, basing my changes on the Salty Marshmallow. I am studying a multitude of the most popular and viewed blogs. As many of them have similar problems, my redesign will be able to improve upon a multitude of sites. Based on my research and studying other usersâ€™ on the site, I have determined distinct aspects that are the most frustrating or difficult to use and understand. Through my heuristic evaluation, I learned that a lack of minimalism was a large issue on these sites. Within the usability test, I was able to review the importance of organization both on the home page and on the individual recipe pages as well. Lastly, through user research and an interview, I understood the necessity of brevity and significance of clean and interesting organization. Because of this research, I will be working to create a site that allows for better and more specific search results along with consolidating and streamlining the site. The overarching goal of the redesign is to streamline the process of looking for and browsing recipes to save users time and energy. 

From the findings from my research, I created three personas:

1. Joseph, a social worker with a passion for entertaining who does not know very much about cooking but is interested in expanding his skills for his friends, some of which who have dietary restrictions
2. Christina, an accountant who enjoys finding new, easy, and healthy recipes for her family, despite her lack of time
3. Nancy, a nurse, mother, and wife, who loves and is very knowledgeable about cooking, especially enjoying finding brand new recipes to try

Based on these personas and their goals, I chose features to assist them:
	
1. Filtering recipes by level of difficulty and dietary restrictions for individuals like Joseph.
2. Finding recipes by specific ingredients for someone like Christina who does not have much time to go and purchase extra ingredients.
3. Browsing popular and well-reviewed recipes on the site, so that someone like Nancy can enjoy looking for new recipes.

The purpose of these low-fidelity prototypes is to take the new introductions to the site and see if a user can navigate through the proposed organization, testing the functionality and ease in particular. I can then identify the issues and additions that the user proposes. I will then be able to alter and revise the prototype before going further with the prototype. 

### Tasks Supported by Prototype

1. Filter Recipes by Cooking Materials, Level of Difficulty, and/or Dietary Restrictions
2. Finding a Recipe by Specific Ingredients
3. Browsing Popular/Well-Reviewed Recipes on the Site
