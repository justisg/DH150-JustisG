# Cooking Blogs and Storytelling
## Justis Guardia - Digital Humanities 150
Cooking blogs and websites are incredibly popular, especially within the demographic of middle-aged women, as they should provide easy access to recipes of all skill levels and with a variety of ingredients. The personal blogs, rather than the food or recipe companies, also allow readers to provide a personal connection to their author through enjoying their recipes and seeing their images. Unfortunately, these pages can become overrun with personal anecdotes and unnecessary details, drastically increasing both the amount of time needed to find a useable recipe and the difficulty in understanding the primary steps. Through my analysis and subsequent design, I hope to provide alternative options for the way these blogs are set up, to benefit both the authors and the readers.

### 10 Heuristics
#1: Visibility of System Status
This site has a complete lack of any interactivity from the user, which I would argue is necessary for a useful recipe website. Despite frequent uploads from the author, there is no clear schedule or easily accessible information on new posts without subscribing to emails or following on additional social media sites.
Severity Rating: 

#2: Match Between System and the Real World
The order in which recipes are listed on the home page and all other categories follows no logical order. On the current front page of the site, the four categories listed are "Appetizers," "Soup Recipes," "Dinner," and "Desserts." Three out of four of these are similar, however the seemingly random included categories are disorienting and make it more difficult to navigate.
Severity Rating: 

#3: User Control and Freedom
There is an option within the header to seach "by ingredient," however selecting that does not take you to a new page. The same happens when the nearby "by cooking type" option is selected. Interestingly, when using the search bar, a user is able to search "by ingredient," but that ability is not made evident anywhere until it is discovered by accident.

#3: User Control and Freedom
There is no ability to input specific ingredients, equipment, or information that would lead to a better match with a recipe. There is also no way to exclude recipes by lack of items.
